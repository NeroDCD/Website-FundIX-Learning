---
This project was developed based on the YouTube tutorial titled **"React JS & Tailwind CSS Responsive Website - Beginner Friendly."** The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to building a fully responsive landing page using React and Tailwind CSS from scratch. 

While the tutorial originally used the `React-Typed` package for text animations in the Hero component, I switched to the `react-typing-effect` package because `React-Typed` caused the page to become unresponsive. Additionally, the tutorial covers:

- Implementing the `useState` hook for toggling the mobile side drawer menu
- Incorporating the `React-Icons` library for social icons
- Designing the layout using both flexbox and grid


**Note:** I modified and added some sections and styles as part of my exploration and learning with React and Tailwind CSS, including:

- The Benefits component
- The badge in the hero section
- Creating reusable styles in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.js`
- Using different assets

These changes were made to enhance my understanding and improve the overall design of the project.
